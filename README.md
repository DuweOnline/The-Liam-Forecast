As the legendary Oasis prepares to kick off their long-awaited 2025 reunion tour at the Principality Stadium, Cardiff on 4 July 2025, fans now have a silly but much-needed way to get ready for the shows: **theliamforecast.com**. 

Created by Oasis fans, for Oasis fans, **theliamforecast.com** brings you Liam Gallagher’s unmistakable vocals, famous for their distinct, no-nonsense tone, predicting whether it will be sunsheeine or showers in each city the band is touring. After all, the British weather might be the only thing more unpredictable than the Gallagher’s themselves.

When asked about the website, Liam himself DEFINITELY (maybe) commented: “Right so, I’m a weather app now. Next thing you know Noel’s gonna be a SatNav, steering you to a dead end. Just don’t blame me if it’s all rain and no shine. Pack yer mac and stop whinging.”*

## Live For Weather

“We wanted to give fans a fun and unexpected way to get involved with the Oasis reunion,” said Ollie Bartlett & Henry Plumridge, Creatives at Transmission, who are behind the idea. “We aimed to capture the energy and unpredictability of Liam and the British weather, giving fans a playful way to get hyped up for the shows ahead.” They worked with web developer, Mark Duwe, to build out the self-updating Liam weather report, from the ground up.

The 2025 Oasis reunion tour is already shaping up to be the most anticipated gig of the decade. The band’s music has always been an essential part of British pop culture, with songs like “Wonderwall,” “Champagne Supernova,” and “Live Forever” soundtracking the lives of millions. The result is a fierce loyalty amongst fans, one that will survive even the harshest of weather conditions. 

Oasis has always had humour at its core. From Liam’s cheeky interviews to the band’s legendary banter, it’s no surprise that the website offers fans a laugh. Every forecast is delivered in a style only Liam could pull off. There’s no polished, weather presenter professionalism here. Instead, it’s unmistakably Gallagher. 

Whether you’re preparing to head to the gig or just getting excited for the tour, **theliamforecast.com** is a fun way to immerse yourself in the hype.
